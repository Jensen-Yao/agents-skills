# Writing Review Checklists

Use this file to prevent omissions during manuscript writing review, paragraph-by-paragraph writing review, LaTeX/format audit, and writing revision planning.

## Intake Checklist

- Target venue, year, track, and paper type are stated, or generic CS conference writing review is explicitly assumed.
- Manuscript scope is stated: abstract only, section, main paper, full paper, appendix, TeX source, reviews, or revised draft.
- Requested mode is selected: quick writing scan, standard writing review, paragraph-by-paragraph review, LaTeX/format audit, consistency audit, or revision planning.
- Missing materials that affect confidence are named.
- Current-year official rules are checked when the user asks for latest policy, page limits, templates, anonymization, or compliance.

## Full Writing Review Checklist

- The paper's intended story is summarized in one sentence.
- Abstract, introduction, contribution list, headings, figures/tables, and conclusion are read before local paragraph comments.
- Contributions are stated as the paper claims them and checked for specificity, overlap, and evidence support.
- High-impact paragraphs receive IDs and local diagnoses.
- Paragraph issues are tied to role, takeaway, logic, evidence, redundancy, and concrete edit action.
- Global motivation and problem-gap-root-challenge chain are checked.
- Claim-evidence alignment is included for major claims.
- The fixed writing profile and applicable writing scorecard from `../fixed-output-format.md` are used; no-score requests receive qualitative criteria.
- Reader perspectives are consolidated inside the writing profile; label them independent only when separate calls were permitted and actually performed.
- Terminology, notation, datasets, models, and contribution wording are checked across sections.
- Prose quality guardrails are checked in context: defensive/incremental framing, label-heavy shorthand, number-only abstracts, formula dumping, third-person manuscript voice, punctuation-driven structure, unsupported hype, or overlong compound sentences are diagnostic signals only when they harm the argument or its clarity. Preserve necessary qualifications, standard notation, and useful structure.
- Related work is checked for closest-work positioning, not citation-list volume.
- Figures/tables/captions/equations/algorithms are checked when present.
- LaTeX/source/template issues are checked when source or snippets are available.
- Weaknesses use the fixed finding record's `critical / major / minor` severity based on actual consequences and are converted into concrete revision actions; a word or style pattern alone cannot determine severity.
- Routine checklist completion stays internal. Use the fixed writing profile without appending a separate checklist-status report or paragraph table unless the user requests one.

## Paragraph-By-Paragraph Checklist

- Paragraph IDs are assigned by section.
- Each high-impact paragraph has a current role and desired reviewer takeaway.
- A paragraph is flagged when its combined roles obscure its main message or logical progression; a coherent paragraph may serve related roles.
- Unsupported claims are tied to the exact missing citation/result/proof/example/qualification.
- Repeated material is marked as cut, merge, move, or appendix candidate.
- Transitions between paragraphs are checked for causal order.
- Sentence rhythm and syntax are checked so paragraphs do not become mechanically uniform.
- Edit actions are concrete: keep, reorder, split, merge, cut, move, qualify, expand, or rewrite.

## LaTeX / Format Checklist

- Template/class/style and anonymity/camera-ready mode match the stated venue when known.
- Sectioning, abstract, appendix, acknowledgments, bibliography, and supplemental material follow the expected structure.
- Labels, refs, citations, and bibliography commands are checked for missing, duplicate, or stale items.
- Figures and tables have readable sizing, self-contained captions, and text references.
- Equations and notation are introduced before use and remain consistent.
- Algorithms use variables that match the method text.
- Manual spacing hacks, excessive resizing, and style-breaking overrides are flagged.
- Compilation status is stated as compiled / inspected only / not available.

## Quick Writing Scan

Use the five-section brief profile in `../fixed-output-format.md` when the user explicitly requests a quick diagnosis. Keep the selected writing scope and evidence-coverage limit in its verdict block; place confusion, located risks, and edit actions in the applicable blocks. Do not create a competing seven-block quick-scan report.

## Revision Planning Checklist

- Every material writing weakness has a revision action.
- Each action has a fix class: writing-fixable, structure-fixable, claim-qualification, citation/positioning, figure/table, LaTeX/format, compression, requires-new-result, accepted-limitation, or venue-mismatch.
- Actions requiring new experiments, proofs, baselines, or studies are separated from writing-only fixes.
- Required edits identify where to revise.
- Claims to weaken, move, support, or remove are listed.
- Risk-reduction condition is tied to reviewer confusion or format compliance.

## Scientific Review Redirect

Select scientific/full mode in this same skill only when scientific assessment is requested. Writing scores, reader perspectives, or writing-risk assessment alone do not expand writing-only scope. Concept-only judgment remains with `ccf-idea-reviewer`.

## Optional Checklist Status

Use the following only when the user requests an audit checklist or completion ledger. In the default writing profile, place material coverage limits in its scope field and unresolved findings in the relevant concern/action fields; do not add a status section.
