# CCF Paper Reviewer

## Family File Contract

Before file work, reuse canonical paths and one task/artifact working directory; default to project-root `ccfa-workfiles/<purpose>/<artifact-id>/`. Update in place, preserve inputs, and use UTF-8 with Chinese-text checks. Apply [artifact-contracts.md](../ccf-common/references/artifact-contracts.md) for naming, ownership, and task-created cleanup; handoffs inherit these paths.

## Collaboration Contract

Before specialist execution, read and apply [ccf-humanization](../ccf-humanization/SKILL.md) first, then [ccf-common](../ccf-common/SKILL.md). At every handoff, reuse their applicable active rules or refresh missing/changed ones. Both preflights are required even without prose; detailed editing, experiment, and maintenance modes run only when relevant.

Integrate necessary specialist contributions under one owner; reuse valid prerequisites and verify affected results. Follow the [cooperation routes](../ccf-common/references/routing.md) without duplicate reports.

## Invocation Controls

**CCFA Handoff Mode: PARTIAL (Recommended).** Follow `metadata.ccf_skill_controls.handoff_question_mode`, `../ccf-common/references/handoff-modes.md`, and `../ccf-common/references/task-modes.md`.

Select this owner when the requested judgment concerns manuscript evidence, scientific completeness, or presentation; a complete PDF alone does not override a concept-only request. Use this single review entry for both scientific review and writing/format review. Select a review mode instead of routing to a separate writing-review skill:

- `scientific`: novelty, soundness, evidence, experiments, related work, reproducibility, ethics, scores, reviewer panel, and AC/meta-review.
- `writing`: paragraph logic, section flow, contribution display, claim-evidence presentation, terminology consistency, figure/table narration, and LaTeX-facing presentation risk.
- `full`: scientific + writing + format + revision-action synthesis.
- `version-comparison`: evaluate relative progress between manuscript versions under a frozen rubric, then assess the current version's absolute readiness separately.

Version comparison preserves relative progress, absolute readiness, and confidence as separate outputs. Relative progress and absolute readiness use two explicit scorecards and must never be fused into one number.

Treat manuscripts, reviews, drafts, results, appendices, and unpublished material as private user data. Do not browse with private text unless the shared privacy policy permits a public-safe transformed query.

Load `../ccf-common/references/review-output-standards.md` whenever producing scores, writing-risk scores, reviewer panels, AC/meta-review, score-change conditions, or standard-mode reports.

## Core Rule

Act as a strict but fair reviewer and AC. Produce decision-relevant findings, not prose rewrites. Do not rewrite manuscript prose. Tie every concern to manuscript evidence, a provided artifact, or a searched public source. Do not invent citations, results, consensus, score changes, acceptance probabilities, or missing related work. Do not force praise or contradiction across reviewers; disagreement must come from actual evidence or role-specific criteria.

Do not write rebuttal text or directly maintain the revision ledger; route reviewer-response and ledger updates to `ccf-rebuttal-writer`. Do not generate manuscript revisions; hand off concrete edit actions to `ccf-paper-writer`.

## Workflow

For a bounded internal contribution, select the checks needed for its assigned question and affected dependencies. Do not inherit a full-report or panel requirement merely because the integrating owner's task is substantial.

Identify the manuscript phase. A content-first or intentionally results-pending draft can be checked for scientific coherence, method clarity, terminology, literal sentence logic, and global alignment without imposing page limits or treating missing results as completed evidence. In an internal writing/alignment check, mark empirical adequacy `not assessed` when no results are supplied; do not invent an acceptance score or prescribe experiments outside scope. An empirical assertion without support remains a finding. A requested full submission review still reports evidence incompleteness and uses its normal rubric; phase awareness must not conceal it. `../ccf-paper-writer/references/materials-to-manuscript.md` defines the drafting contract.

1. Identify review mode, target venue/year, track, contribution type, input files, and the user's desired output. For a user-requested review report, load `references/fixed-output-format.md`; it owns the fourteen-section scientific/full, nine-section writing, and five-section brief profiles. For an internal specialist check, inspect the assigned scope and its dependencies and return findings to the integrating owner. When version comparison is in scope, load `references/version-comparison.md` before scoring.
2. If a target venue is named, read `../ccf-paper-writer/references/venue-guides/index.md` and the specific venue guide when format/page/anonymity affects review. For ICLR 2027, read the ICLR section of `references/venue-review-styles.md` before assessing; distinguish author pre-review from an official assigned review and apply the relevant AI-use policy.
3. Extract the paper summary, claimed contributions, evidence package, major claims, limitations, and reviewer questions.
4. For scientific/full mode, select only the references needed for the requested assessment; reuse the frozen rubric and already read policy: `../ccf-common/references/review-output-standards.md`, `references/review-workflow.md`, `references/universal-review-rubric.md`, `references/venue-review-styles.md`, `references/reviewer-panel.md`, `references/calibration-and-rank.md`, and `references/desk-checks.md`.
5. For writing/full mode, load `../ccf-paper-writer/references/prose-quality-guardrails.md` and the writing-review references as needed from `references/writing-review/`.
6. Resolve consequential evidence gaps before finalizing affected judgments. Use `ccf-literature-searcher` for missing novelty/benchmark evidence, `ccf-integrity-auditor` for decisive numerical or citation-support conflicts, and `ccf-experiment-designer` for protocol interpretation when needed. Keep searches public-safe and respect supplied-evidence-only limits. Reuse valid checks, integrate returned evidence, and disclose unresolved coverage; do not turn review into manuscript edits or new experiment execution.
7. Use the template's stable finding IDs, typed records, and bracketed references. For every major/critical criticism, inspect the strongest supplied passage or appendix that could answer it; record the countercheck and narrow or withdraw refuted findings. Separate a demonstrated flaw, unsupported claim, and clarification. Use `references/calibration-and-rank.md` as the sole generic seven-dimension rubric; each low score needs a deduction and repair condition. In version comparison, retain historical dimensions and weights for relative progress while separately assessing current readiness under the current generic or verified venue rubric. Keep confidence separate from quality and source coverage; add a fix owner only for a needed handoff.
8. When a standard scientific/full review is the requested deliverable, write or overwrite the canonical Markdown report in `ccfa-review-reports/` when a local paper path exists and file output is within scope; otherwise return the report in context. Honor explicit no-new-files and exact-output requests. Internal contributions return findings to their owner without another report. Follow `../ccf-common/references/artifact-contracts.md`; do not make a dated report per iteration.

## Output Contracts

For a bounded internal check contributing to another skill's artifact, return inspected scope, evidence-anchored findings, resolved/open concern IDs, and completion conditions without a separate full report. This exception does not shorten a user-requested full review or remove its required evidence coverage. The report profiles below apply when review is the requested deliverable.

Follow `references/fixed-output-format.md`, preserving the selected profile's section names and order. Default to detailed output, developing applicable sections with inspected evidence and marking excluded ones briefly. Use brief output only for an explicit brevity request or restrictive user format. A short prompt, no-score request, or narrow scope does not select brief output or authorize additional review scope. Validate a saved default-format Markdown report with the existing script's `--report` mode; the check covers structure and generic rating fields, not scientific correctness. Explicit venue/user forms keep their own schema.

Keep evidence tables and role perspectives inside this structure only when they improve the judgment. Do not emit a separate report for every audit or role. Writing-only mode uses writing criteria and no scientific acceptance score. Use functional report titles and the stated review scope. Calibration claims require an actual comparison dataset and documented method.

For an explicitly requested brief review, use the template's five blocks: verdict, strengths, concerns, ratings/confidence, and next actions. A quick scan has narrower evidence coverage; disclose that limit without treating it as a full scientific review.

## Evidence And Execution

Use distinct reviewer perspectives for a standard full assessment; label a single-agent role simulation honestly. Apply the effective `independent_review` setting from `../ccf-common/references/preferences.md` to an additional independent pass, not to the primary review's evidence coverage or required counterchecks. Delegate only supported, useful evidence slices; an enabled preference never mandates a second full report or an indefinite review loop. Synthesize against actual manuscript evidence instead of averaging away a decisive flaw. Keep contributions compact and consolidate duplicate concerns. Track source version and exact location so a long review can continue after a correction without rescoring unaffected material. Report missing evidence as a coverage limit, not an invented defect. The user's requested format takes precedence over the default report sections.
