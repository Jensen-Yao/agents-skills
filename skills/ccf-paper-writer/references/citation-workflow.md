# Citation Workflow

Use this reference when a draft needs literature support or citation changes. A verified existing bibliography and inspected sources are reusable evidence; a new paragraph does not require a new search for the same paper.

## Evidence Before Citation Counts

Every substantive claim about prior work needs an appropriate source. Cite the closest work, borrowed mechanisms, external datasets, benchmarks, metrics, and relevant foundations. Define the current work's own task, resource, or metric directly and cite its actual predecessors when applicable; it does not need a fictitious external source. Judge coverage by the argument, not reference quotas. An abstract or conclusion needs citations only when its content or venue convention calls for them.

## Workflow

1. Locate citation needs in the changed passage or planned section. Inspect the existing bibliography and current source notes first; preserve citation keys. Group unresolved needs by source identity or technical question rather than searching separately for each sentence.
2. Reuse previously verified entries and inspected supporting passages when their source version and claim remain applicable. New claims, changed paper versions, or final current-policy decisions require the relevant recheck. Bibliographic existence alone does not establish support for a statement.
3. For an unresolved known work, retrieve its official/proceedings page or metadata from DBLP, Crossref, Semantic Scholar, or arXiv as appropriate. For an unresolved topic, request targeted retrieval from `ccf-literature-searcher` with the exact support needed. Batch independent public-safe searches and deduplicate by stable paper identity before deeper reading.
4. Inspect the primary source passage that supports the intended claim. Record source identity/version and page/section location in the existing evidence notes only when persistence is useful. Do not paste entire abstracts or extracted papers into every writing handoff. Supplied-evidence-only and no-browsing requests retain unresolved references explicitly; never invent titles, authors, entries, or measurements.
5. Obtain accurate metadata: authors, title, year, publication/source, and DOI or stable URL as available. Prefer the verified publication version when appropriate. Preserve complete author lists rather than manufacturing an `et al.` author field. An unresolved field remains unresolved.
6. Update the existing bibliography in a batch after validating candidate entries. For new keys, use the project's convention or `<firstauthor><year><first-title-word>`. Keep a single canonical bibliography for a new project unless its template needs another arrangement; preserve established multi-file projects. Reuse an existing key for the same paper and do not delete unrelated uncited entries during ordinary drafting.
7. Insert citations naturally, usually making the scientific finding, method, or dataset the subject. Author-name subjects are appropriate when attribution itself matters; avoid a paper-by-paper catalogue, not author names categorically. Group works by a real shared idea. Repeat citations where needed for unambiguous attribution; do not merge unrelated claims merely to suppress a repeated key.
8. Check changed citation keys against the bibliography and verify support for the changed claims. For a full manuscript, check overall relevant coverage. Run the existing bibliography build when compiling the paper or diagnosing a bibliographic error, not after every inserted reference.

## Missing Support And Handoffs

Keep unresolved source needs in the delivery note or an existing authorized evidence record, naming the affected passage and support needed. Do not put `TBD` in manuscript prose, create fake citation keys, or turn a missing citation into generic caution. If the user explicitly requests visible citation placeholders in an internal draft, use a clear descriptive marker, not a fabricated bibliography entry. Without support, do not present a prior-art assertion as verified; continue independently supported writing.

For requested broad discovery use `ccf-literature-searcher`; for citation-context or existing metadata audits use `ccf-integrity-auditor`; for final package builds use `ccf-submission-checker`. Necessary steps inside an authorized combined workflow continue under shared handoff rules. A routine paragraph edit does not automatically trigger a separate full bibliography audit.

## Acceptance

The requested claims have verified support or explicit unresolved status; every inserted key resolves; source versions and attribution remain accurate; no unrelated entries or manuscript structure were changed. Deliver the revised prose and bibliography changes, with concise evidence gaps only when material. Do not include an extra citation-density report unless requested.
