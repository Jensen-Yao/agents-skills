# ccfa.yaml Contract

`ccfa.yaml` is the shared paper-project state file introduced in v0.4.0.

Optional personal settings use the separate `.ccfa/preferences.json` described in `preferences.md`; they do not change this state schema or require creating `ccfa.yaml`. Existing projects without preferences retain the default behavior.

Required top-level fields:

- `version`
- `project`
- `target_venue`
- `stage`
- `artifacts`
- `claims`
- `experiments`
- `reviews`
- `revision_ledger`
- `submission_checks`

Only `ccf-project-scaffolder` should create it by default. `ccf-pipeline-orchestrator` may update stage and gate state. Other skills may read it and propose updates unless the user explicitly grants write permission.

Task continuity does not change this ownership or schema. Use existing authorized fields/report context first; an optional task-local recovery record follows [continuity.md](continuity.md) and never grants additional project-state write permissions.

Optional monitoring fields:

- `literature_monitor`
- `tracked_competitors`
- `watch_queries`
- `last_monitoring_report`

`ccf-literature-monitor` may propose updates to these fields after a watch run. It must not silently overwrite project state unless the user explicitly asks it to persist the monitoring summary.

## Path Resolution And Iteration

Keep the existing schema version and top-level fields. Resolve `project.root` relative to the directory containing `ccfa.yaml`, then resolve relative artifact paths against that project root. Existing mappings and explicit user paths take precedence over default folders. Do not change paths merely to adopt a new naming convention.

Use `artifact-contracts.md` for canonical outputs, one working directory per artifact, on-demand source/cache/build placement, and update-in-place rules. Only store a path in project state when the artifact actually exists or is clearly marked as planned; do not claim an old export is refreshed after a failed rebuild. Reuse existing state/report fields rather than introducing a new schema or per-step manifest.

For an explicitly requested autonomous experiment campaign, the orchestrator may link the actual run directory through existing artifact/experiment fields. The campaign's execution contract and records remain task-local and do not add top-level fields or change this schema. Ordinary projects need neither a campaign nor its records.
